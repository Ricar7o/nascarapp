NascarApp - Car racing mini-game
1. There are several car objects with randomly generated distances traveled every period of time.
2. Everytime the last car passes through the starting line, we paint a picture that shows where each
car is in relation to the others.
3. We take in bets on each car using the Twitter API from a specific account.
4. If that account is @mentioned and the tweet follows a format, we place the bet for that person.
5. Every elapsed lap, the bets are worth less and less.
6. At the end of the race, we publish the results.
7. We print out a summary of earnings and payments.
