Hashtag Races
=========

A console app that lets you create a race between hashtags on Twitter.
The user selects the hashtags to include in the competition and the app starts.
Everytime the user hits Enter the app connects to Twitter and grabs the latest tweets
containing those hashtags, gives them a weight based on how recent they were and 
presents ASCII art to display the standings.
